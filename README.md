# LiDAR Data Processing and Convex Hull Visualization üõ∞Ô∏èüåç

In this project, I processed LiDAR data to visualize the outer shell (Convex Hull) of a scanned area. This visualization is useful for applications such as 3D mapping, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. The process involves reading data in polar coordinates, converting it to Cartesian coordinates, and then using the **ConvexHull** algorithm to outline the scanned environment.

## üöÄ Key Steps:

### 1. **Data Collection**
   LiDAR sensors capture data in polar coordinates ‚Äî **angle (Œ∏)** and **distance (r)**. This data is read from a text file and parsed into arrays for further processing.

### 2. **Coordinate Transformation**
   The polar coordinates (distance and angle) are converted to **Cartesian coordinates (x, y)**, which are easier to plot and analyze.

### 3. **Convex Hull Calculation**
   The **ConvexHull** algorithm from **SciPy** is used to find the boundary that contains all the points in the data. This boundary represents the outer limits of the scanned area.

### 4. **Data Visualization**
   A **2D plot** is generated showing the Convex Hull, which highlights the outer boundary of the LiDAR scan. This is useful for understanding the shape of the scanned area and can be applied to many fields, including navigation and environmental modeling.

## üìä **Visualization Output:**
The outer shell (Convex Hull) is filled with a light blue color, representing the scanned area. This plot helps visualize the physical environment captured by the LiDAR sensor. By drawing the convex boundary, we can quickly assess the shape and extent of the scanned area.

## üåü **Applications and Use Cases:**
- **Robotics and Autonomous Vehicles**: Helps map out the environment and detect obstacles.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Used in creating 3D models of terrains and structures.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Helps visualize scanned regions in forest, agriculture, or environmental studies.

Feel free to explore more on how such visualizations can enhance real-time applications!
